        "\n",
        "This is an essential tool for making complex data easier to understand, communicate, and interpret. By transforming raw data into graphical representations, you can uncover patterns, relationships, trends, and outliers that might not be evident from numbers alone. Visualizations is a huge part of the exploratory data analysis process as we would see later.\n",

        "### Core Libraries for Visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "- Matplotlib: The foundational library for Python plotting. It offers control over every element of a plot and is useful for both basic and advanced static visualizations.\n",
        "- Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for statistical data visualization, making it easier to create attractive and informative visualizations.\n",
        "- Plotly: A library for creating interactive plots that can be embedded in web pages and Jupyter Notebooks. Great for dashboards and presentations.\n",
        "- Pandas Visualization: Provides basic plotting functionality through `.plot()` directly on DataFrames and Series, using Matplotlib as a backend.\n",

        "Below is a guide to different plot types, when to use what, and how to interpret them.\n",

        "Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "- When to Use: Line plots are ideal for visualizing data points over a continuous period, such as time series data, trends, or changes over intervals.\n",
        "- Interpretation: The slope and direction of the line indicate the rate and direction of change. Peaks and valleys help identify patterns, anomalies, and seasonality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tips\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use line plots to track continuous data, like stock prices or temperature over time.\n",
